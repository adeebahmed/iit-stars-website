                <p>The students and faculty that compose our team are from the Illinois Institute of Technology's computer science department. Our beginnings started with a Saturday program for middle school girls (6th-8th) with the goal of cultivating a love for computer science, an uncommon field for women. This program quickly grew as we expanded our team and our programs. We even added more short and long term goals and a 4-week after school program!</p>
                <p>Through teaching the students the LEGO mindstorm interface, how to build the robot and program the robot, we are accomplishing our goals. Students are excited and motivated to learn how to program games for themselves. Our team quickly became mentors to them, encouraging them to ask us questions about anything while we keep the lines of communication open. We are excited to push forward and grow during this upcoming year!</p>

                        <p> I have been teaching Computer Science at IIT for 15 years. Being the faculty advisor for the STARS corps has been a very rewarding experience. The STARS students have enriched the summer and Saturday outreach computer programs and enabled the programs to grow. I've enjoyed getting to know the STARS students outside the classroom; STARS has provided the opportunity for me to guide and support students in developing important life skills. </p>

                        <p>Computer Science and Mathematics are my academic loves, and I enjoy showing others that they are lovely. As a teacher assistant at Illinois Institute of Technology and a member of Stars, I get a chance to show others of their love. Alongside spreading my love for Computer Science and Mathematics, I enjoy developing applications for Android phones, iPhones, Windows, and Mac OS X. When I need to be away from the computer screen, I spend my time doing martial arts.</p>

                <p>I'm a 4th and a half year in school, and I enjoy anything to do with soccer, reading, and talking to people. STARs is important to me because I think its really important to give back to the community that's helped you get this far, and increase diversity in the STEM fields. This semester I am the president of the International Student Organization, and work as a teaching assistant for the CS department and as a Peer Mentor for the Office of Campus Life. </p>
