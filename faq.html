										 <p> Is your child creative and interested in designing new things? Does she show an interest in her science, math, or technology classes? Does she like to find more than one way to solve a problem? Does she want to find a way to change the world? Maybe your student should consider computer science as a career.</p>
<p>
										  Our camp will expose students to computer science and help them understand the work of technology that is all around them. We engage them with fun activities that challenge them to design creative solutions to common problems found in computer science allowing them to dive into the field and really understand what it is about.</p>

                                <p>Scholarships can be requested for need-based students. Since we do not wish to receive personal financial information from families, we rely on the school to indicate to us if a family has a demonstrated need. Generally, participation in the free and reduced lunch program is an indicator, but a school counselor or other school official may be able to speak to other factors influencing financial need.</p>

						  <h3>For Educators</h3>
						  <p>As educators we know that you have some of the best insight into the interests and aptitudes of your students. We would like to help you identify students who may find great enjoyment and success in the fields of computer science and technology.</p>

										  <p>Because you know your students the best we ask that, if you have identified one that may have interests in this field, you recommend our program. We can provide a more in depth education about computer science to help the students better realize how their interests fit in this career.</p>

										  <p>Outside of the camp, we can also bring demonstrations and activities directly into the classroom during the school year. If you would like to expose your students to the field of computer science and new technology we can work with you to bring in IIT students and professors to show the students what the field is all about. We can also provide you with interesting activities that will engage the students while teaching them to think computationally.</p>
